description: "Validate Modelica models (.mo files) by flattening them with WSMKernelX. Use this skill whenever the user asks to validate, check, test, or verify a Modelica model, or when you've just created or edited a .mo file and want to confirm it compiles. Triggers on phrases like 'validate this model', 'check my .mo file', 'does this Modelica model compile', 'flatten the model', or any mention of checking Modelica code with WSMKernelX."

# Validate Modelica Model

This skill validates Modelica models (.mo files) by flattening them with WSMKernelX, which checks for structural errors (equations, types, connections). A successful flatten means the model is structurally valid.

## Before you run anything

This skill drives WSMKernelX through the shared launcher
`../scripts/wsm_run.py`. **Read [the shared-conventions appendix at the end of this file](#appendix-shared-conventions-for-the-modelica-skills)
first** — launcher resolution, the Windows-vs-Unix shell/Python rules, the
temp-dir and cleanup conventions, the JSON-array output gotcha, and the MSL 4.x
dialect notes that every step below assumes.

The launcher writes everything into `_wsm_validate_temp/` next to the `.mo`
file and leaves `validate.out.json` there for you to parse. Tell the user:
"Working in temporary directory `_wsm_validate_temp/`. This will be deleted
after validation."

## Workflow

### 1. Identify the model file and name

Identify the `.mo` file and extract the **model name** — see [Appendix → Picking the model name](#picking-the-model-name). For a **directory-form (multi-file) library**, point `--model` at the library folder (not one class file) and pass the full dotted `--name` — see [Appendix → Directory-form (multi-file) libraries](#directory-form-multi-file-libraries).

### 2. Run the launcher

```bash
python3 "<scripts-dir>/wsm_run.py" --mode validate \
  --model "<path-to-ModelFile.mo>" --name ModelName --timeout 60
```

The launcher auto-detects whether the model needs the Modelica Standard
Library and loads the right MSL version; force it with `--msl yes|no` or pin a
version with `--msl-version 4.1.0`. If the model uses an installed non-MSL
library (e.g. `Hydraulic`), add `--load-library <Name>` — see
[Appendix → Using non-MSL libraries](#using-non-msl-libraries-hydraulic-and-other-installed-libraries).
Timeout: allow up to 60 seconds — complex models with many components can take a while to flatten.

If the launcher can't find the System Modeler install, see
[Appendix → When the install or compiler isn't found](#when-the-install-or-compiler-isnt-found).

### 3. Parse the output

WSMKernelX writes structured results to `validate.out.json` in the temp
directory — a JSON *array*; take the first element. **`status.flatten`**
(`"Pass"`/`"Fail"`) is the primary result; `flat_model` holds the flattened
class (useful for debugging). Field reference:
[Appendix → Reading the JSON output](#reading-the-json-output).

### 4. Report results

Summarize clearly:
- **Pass**: State the model validated successfully. Mention any warnings if present.
- **Fail**: Show the errors. Include relevant parts of the flattened model if it helps diagnose the issue.

### 5. Clean up

Remove `_wsm_validate_temp/` entirely — commands per OS: [Appendix → Temporary directories](#temporary-directories).

## Edge cases

- **Packages / name mismatches**: parse the actual `model`/`package` declaration, not the filename — see [Appendix → Picking the model name](#picking-the-model-name).
- **`Unknown library: X` on a multi-file library**: you pointed `--model` at a single class file; point it at the library folder instead — see [Appendix → Directory-form (multi-file) libraries](#directory-form-multi-file-libraries).
- **WSMKernelX not found**: see [Appendix → When the install or compiler isn't found](#when-the-install-or-compiler-isnt-found).
- **MSL dialect / `Element not found`**: this toolchain ships MSL 4.x — author with the 4.x names; the 3.2 names and misremembered paths flatten with confusing "not found" errors. Look the correct path up with `search-modelica-docs` (don't grep the install tree). See [Appendix → MSL 4.x dialect](#msl-4x-dialect).

## Appendix: shared conventions for the Modelica skills

> *Shared by every Modelica skill that drives WSMKernelX through the
> bundled launcher; inlined here at release time. For the CLI/option
> reference, environment variables (`WSM_HOME`, `WSM_VSDEVCMD`),
> install discovery, and the analysis scripts, see
> [`../scripts/README.md`](../scripts/README.md).*

### Locating the launcher

`<scripts-dir>` (used throughout the skills) is the shared `scripts/` folder.
Some installs symlink the skill directories without it, so resolve it in this
order and use the first that exists:

1. `$WSM_SKILLS_SCRIPTS` (bash) or `$env:WSM_SKILLS_SCRIPTS` (PowerShell), if set.
2. `../scripts` relative to the skill directory — in a normal install
   `../scripts/wsm_run.py` already exists, so use that path directly; **do not run
   a shell probe to "resolve" it.**
3. The repo checkout you installed from, e.g. `.../agentskills/scripts`.
4. Last resort, search the home directory:
   - PowerShell: `Get-ChildItem $HOME -Recurse -Filter wsm_run.py -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -First 1`
   - bash/zsh: `find ~ -name wsm_run.py -path '*scripts*' 2>/dev/null | head -1`

If only #4 finds it, the install is missing the `scripts/` link — tell the user
to run `install.sh` (or `install.ps1`) from the repo, which links `scripts/` too.

### Shell and Python

**On Windows, use PowerShell.** The Git-Bash/cygwin layer may be broken (even
`ls`/`find` can be absent, giving a misleading "exit 127 / command not found").
Run `wsm_run.py` with `python` (not `python3`); those calls are single-line and
shell-agnostic. For cleanup use `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force`, not `rm -rf`.
On macOS/Linux any POSIX shell is fine and `python3` is the usual name.

### Let the launcher own .mos/.bat and paths

Do **not** hand-write `.mos` scripts, `.bat` files, or hardcode install/compiler
paths. The bundled `scripts/wsm_run.py` handles every OS difference — it finds
the System Modeler install and kernel binary (macOS / Windows / Linux), finds and
loads the right MSL files, generates the `.mos`, and runs the kernel with a
working compiler environment per platform (system clang/gcc on macOS/Linux; the
Visual Studio dev environment via `VsDevCmd.bat` on Windows).
See [`../scripts/README.md`](../scripts/README.md) for `WSM_HOME`, the Windows compiler prerequisites,
and the full option table.

### When the install or compiler isn't found

The launcher searches each OS's standard install locations. If it prints
`ERROR: Could not locate a Wolfram System Modeler installation`, the install
is in a non-standard place — ask the user for it and re-run with
`--wsm-home "<path>"` (or have them set `WSM_HOME`).

Building and simulating also need a C++ toolchain:

- **Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools. The launcher locates `VsDevCmd.bat`
  itself; if it reports the compiler environment is missing, pass
  `--vsdevcmd "<path-to-VsDevCmd.bat>"` (or set `WSM_VSDEVCMD`) and make sure
  Build Tools are installed.
- **macOS**: the Xcode command-line tools (`xcode-select --install`).
- **Linux**: gcc/g++.

Run `python3 "<scripts-dir>/wsm_run.py" --mode info` to see what the launcher
discovered.

### Temporary directories

The launcher works in a `_wsm_<mode>_temp/` directory next to the `.mo` file
(`_wsm_validate_temp/`, `_wsm_simulate_temp/`, `_wsm_diagnose_temp/`) and leaves
its outputs there. Tell the user, e.g.: "Working in temporary directory
`_wsm_<mode>_temp/`. This will be deleted afterwards." Pass `--tempdir`
to reuse one directory across models in a session.

Clean up by removing the whole directory — use the user's shell:

```bash
rm -rf "<model-dir>/_wsm_<mode>_temp"          # macOS / Linux
# PowerShell: Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "<model-dir>\_wsm_<mode>_temp"
```

### Picking the model name

- The user may provide a path to a `.mo` file, or you may already be working with
  one in context.
- Extract the **model name**: the identifier after `model` on the first non-comment
  line, e.g. `model FooBar` → `FooBar`. The filename does not always match the
  model name — parse the actual `model`/`package` declaration.
- For packages or nested models, use the **top-level** model name.
- **Pick an instantiable model, not a package**, for any kernel call. A `package`
  cannot be validated or simulated ("Invalid instantiation … is a package") — use
  a nested model's full dotted name, e.g. `Package.Model`.
- Pass an **absolute path** to `--model` (relative paths break as the working
  directory shifts between calls).

### Directory-form (multi-file) libraries

A directory-form library stores one class per file with a `package.mo` at each
level. You **cannot** validate such a class by handing the launcher only its own
`.mo` file — the class's `within Lib;` clause needs the whole package loaded, and
loading the single file alone fails with
`Internal error: ... expandLibNode: Unknown library: Lib`. Instead point
`--model` at the **library folder** (or its top `package.mo`, or any class file
inside it) and pass the **full dotted class name** via `--name`:

```bash
python3 "<scripts-dir>/wsm_run.py" --mode validate \
  --model "/abs/path/InvertedPendulum" \
  --name InvertedPendulum.Controller
```

The launcher resolves any of those forms up to the library's root `package.mo`
and loads the entire package (following `package.order`) before instantiating
`--name`. It prints a `NOTE:` telling you which `package.mo` it loaded. Do **not**
try to work around the unknown-library error by `--load`-ing individual files.

### Reading the JSON output

The kernel writes `<mode>.out.json` into the temp dir. **It is a JSON *array* —
take the first element**, then read:

- **`status.flatten`**: `"Pass"` / `"Fail"` (the primary result for `validate`).
- **`status.build`**: `"Pass"` / `"Fail"` — C++ compilation/linking (`simulate`).
- **`status.result`**: simulation result status (`simulate`).
- **`messages.errors`** / **`messages.warnings`** / **`messages.notifications`**:
  arrays (empty if none).
- **`flat_model`** (`validate`) / **`simulation.resultFile`** (`simulate`): the
  flattened class / path to the `.mat`.

See [`../scripts/README.md`](../scripts/README.md) (`wsm_run.py` section) for the full field reference.

### MSL 4.x dialect

This toolchain ships **MSL 4.x**. When authoring models, use the 4.x names — the
3.2 names flatten with confusing "not found" errors:

- units: `Modelica.Units.SI.*` (not `Modelica.SIunits.*`)
- source frequency parameter: `f` (not `freqHz`), e.g. `SineVoltage(V=.., f=..)`
- declare the dependency as `annotation(uses(Modelica(version="4.0.0")))`

Run `python3 "<scripts-dir>/wsm_run.py" --mode info` to confirm the exact MSL
version. `wsm_run.py` also warns on stderr if it spots a 3.2 name in the model.

**When a flatten fails with `Element not found ... in Modelica...`**, the MSL
component path is wrong (a misremembered name, not a missing install). Resolve
the correct path with the **search-modelica-docs** skill — e.g. sine is
`Modelica.Blocks.Sources.Sine` (not `Math.Sine`), difference is `Math.Feedback`
(not `Math.Subtract`), and saturation is `Nonlinear.Limiter` (not
`Nonlinear.Saturation`). **Do not** grep or walk the System Modeler install tree
to hunt for the class.

### Using non-MSL libraries (Hydraulic, and other installed libraries)

MSL is automatic (`--msl`). For **any other** library a model uses — Hydraulic, or
anything the user installed from the Library Store — the launcher can find it for you.
Two steps, no guessing at paths:

1. **See what is installed** (bundled with System Modeler, user-installed archives, and
   any custom folders configured in Model Center):

   ```bash
   python3 "<scripts-dir>/wsm_run.py" --mode libraries
   # add --json for a machine-readable array; each row has name/version/source/package
   ```

   To get just one library's package path (e.g. for a manual `--load`):
   `--mode libraries --library Hydraulic` (add `--library-version 2.1` to pin a version).

2. **Load it into a build** by name — add `--load-library <Name>` to a validate /
   simulate / diagnose run (repeatable; pin a version with `Name==Ver`):

   ```bash
   python3 "<scripts-dir>/wsm_run.py" --mode validate \
     --model "<path>/M.mo" --name M --load-library Hydraulic
   ```

   The launcher resolves the library (bundled → user-installed → Model-Center custom
   path, newest version wins) and `loadFile`s it before the model. A library usually
   pulls in MSL, so keep MSL on (auto, or `--msl yes`). Override a lookup with
   `$WSM_LIBRARY_<NAME>` (e.g. `WSM_LIBRARY_HYDRAULIC=/path/to/package.moe`), or fall
   back to an explicit `--load <path-to-package.mo|.moe>`.
